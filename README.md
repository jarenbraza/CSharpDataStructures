# CSharpDataStructures
C# implementations of data structure and algorithms.

## How It Works
The CSharpDataStructures directory contains a data structure library, such as Binary Search Tree (and hopefully more by the time of writing).

The CSharpDataStructures.Test directory contains unit tests for the data structure library, with NUnit being used for the unit-testing framework.

## Motivation
This project is mainly to practice NUnit and some C# quirks.
