# CSharpDataStructures
C# implementations of data structure and algorithms.

## How It Works
The CSharpDataStructures directory contains a data structure library, such as Binary Search Tree (and hopefully more by the time of writing).

The CSharpDataStructures.Test directory contains unit tests for the data structure library.

## Motivation
This project is mainly to practice JUnit and some C# quirks.
